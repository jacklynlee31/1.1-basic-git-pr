    My name is Jacklyn Carroll and I am currently a student at The Iron Yard in Little Rock, Arkansas. I chose to learn how to develop because I love learning how things work. I used to build basic websites when I was younger, and I always loved figuring out how to write the html and why something was or wasn't working. I also know that learning how to code will help me find a better job. My main career goal is to do something that helps others, and I think coding will add the advantage I need to get a job that I love.
